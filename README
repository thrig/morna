morna - simple "text" pattern generation routines for Common LISP

"Pattern generation" here means the manipulation of simple text grids
and not pattern matching or macros or anything fancy like that. For
example, given the array

  #2A((#\. #\#) (#\# #\.))

an Angband-type vault can be constructed with somthing like

  (defun chain (grid ops)
    (dolist (opl ops)
      (let ((fn (pop opl)))
        (setf grid (apply fn grid opl))))
    grid)

  (chain #2A((#\. #\#) (#\# #\.))
    '((morna-multiply 3 7)
      (morna-border 1 #\#)
      (morna-border 1 #\.)
      (morna-border 1 #\#))))

producing (by way of the eg/synopsis.lisp file)

Some of the routines should work on array of any dimensions (up to
ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT) while others are restricted to "grids" or 2D
arrays, mostly due to N-dimensional support being tricky to implement,
and I really only need 2D at the moment.


INSTALLATION

install for ASDF, e.g.

  mkdir -p "$HOME"/.local/share/common-lisp/source
  cd "$HOME"/.local/share/common-lisp/source
  git clone https://github.com/thrig/morna

or instead install for Quicklisp, e.g.

  cd .../where/you/put/stuff/from/github
  git clone https://github.com/thrig/morna
  cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
  ln -s .../path/to/morna

the eg/synopsis.lisp file might be worth a peek for how to use this
system, or upvary.lisp over in
https://github.com/thrig/ministry-of-silly-vaults/


TESTING

The tests can perhaps be run via something like

  (ql:quickload :morna)
  (asdf:test-system :morna)

or via

  make test

assumming SBCL and Quicklisp are available (and make, and anything else
that I've forgotten to mention. A working computer? Yes, you'll probably
want one of those.).


HISTORY

This code is based on the Game::TextPatterns Perl module, though being a
second implementation it hopefully improves on said source without the
bloat that is so typical in second system implementations.
